A lightweight Pomodoro timer with no frameworks, written in Vanilla JS and using HTML5 Canvas for display. My last front-end dev project for FreeCodeCamp: I now am submitting for my certification. Hooray!

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
